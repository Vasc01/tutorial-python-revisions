== Software Development Models ==

A typical project will combine one or more of these models. For example a project may use the
Agile Model for the frontend and the DevOps Model for the backend. The following table shows the
different development models and their characteristics:

|====

|Model | Characteristics

|Waterfall a| The Waterfall Model is a sequential development process where the steps of the
development process are performed one after the other.

*Advantages*

- Easy to understand and use
- Each step can be planned in advance
- Each step must be completed before the next step can begin

*Disadvantages*

- One of the first models and thus in many cases outdated
- Difficult to go back to a previous step once it is completed
- Difficult to estimate the time and cost of each step
- Long development time that might lead to outdated requirements
- Testing is not emphasized

*Usecases*

- Fail-safe systems with human lives at stake where cost is not an issue
- Small projects with well-defined requirements where the cost is an issue


|V-Model
a|
The V-Model is a sequential development process where the steps of the development process are
performed one after the other. It is an extension of the Waterfall Model where each step of the
development process must have a fully planned and defined corresponding testing step. Without it
the development process cannot continue.

*Advantages*

- Easy to understand and use
- Each step can be planned in advance
- Each step must be completed before the next step can begin
- Testing is a part of the process

*Disadvantages*

- The test planning for each step delays the development process
- A change in the requirements requires a change in the test plan
- Long development time that might lead to outdated requirements
- Difficult to go back to a previous step once it is completed
- Difficult to estimate the time and cost of each step
- Very rigid and inflexible

*When to use*

- Small projects
- Well defined and stable requirements
- Technology used is well known and understood
- Free resources with the required expertise
- Projects with strict requirements and regulations




|Spiral
a| The Spiral Model is an iterative development process where Ð° pre-defined set of steps are
performed periodically until a stable release is achieved. The final prototype is used as the
basis for the final system.

*Advantages*

- Prototyping in each iteration
- Each iteration delivers a fully working and tested prototype
- High risk features might be implemented first
- After each iteration the customer can provide feedback
- Better cost estimation

*Disadvantages*

- Costly due to the risk analysis and prototyping in each iteration
- Requires a high level of expertise to perform the risk analysis
- Indefinite spiral that might never end if the customer is not satisfied

*When to use*

- Large and complex projects with long-term commitments
- Features that migth introduce high risk and break the system
- Customer is not sure about the requirements
- Projects with strict conformity requirements
- Industries: Aerospace, Defense, Government, Gaming, etc.


|Agile | The Agile Model is an iterative development process where the same steps of the
development process are performed periodically. It is an extension of the Spiral Model where
each iteration is a fully working system.


|Prototyping | The Prototyping Model is an iterative development process where the same steps of
the development process are performed periodically. It is an extension of the Spiral Model where
each iteration is a fully working system. It is suitable for projects with changing requirements.

|DevOps | The DevOps Model is an iterative development process where
the same steps of the development process are performed periodically. It is an extension of the
Agile Model where each iteration is a fully working system. It is suitable for projects with
changing requirements.
