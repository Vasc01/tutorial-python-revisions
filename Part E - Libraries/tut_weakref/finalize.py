https://pymotw.com/3/weakref/

For more robust management of resources when weak references are cleaned up, use finalize to associate callbacks
with objects. A finalize instance is retained until the attached object is deleted, even if the application does
not retain a reference to the finalizer.

The arguments to finalize are the object to track, a callable to invoke when the object is garbage collected,
and any positional or named arguments to pass to the callable.

The finalize instance has a writable propertly atexit to control whether the callback is invoked as a program is
exiting, if it hasnâ€™t already been called.

The default is to invoke the callback. Setting atexit to false disables that behavior.

Warning:
1. Giving the finalize instance a reference to the object it tracks causes a reference to be retained, so the object
is never garbage collected.
2. Using a bound method of a tracked object as the callable can also prevent an object from being finalized properly.
