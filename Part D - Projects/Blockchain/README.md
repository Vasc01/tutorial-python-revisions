## Wallet

Wallets store private keys and public keys used to authorize transactions. The user might have 
one or more key pairs for each blockchain. 

## Transaction

Transaction is a data structure containing relevant info about the fund transfer such as the 
sender, receiver and the quantity. Additionally some meta information is added to ensure the 
secure transfer such as the digital signature and the nonce (a counter, which is incremented 
with each transaction from the sender).
