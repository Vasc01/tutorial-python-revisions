== Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming is a programming technique where a program is designed to manipulate or generate
code during runtime. It allows a program to treat code as data and work with it programmatically.
Metaprogramming can be a powerful tool in a developer's toolbox, but it should be used
judiciously, as it can make code more complex and harder to understand.

Here are some common forms and examples of metaprogramming:

- *Code Generation*: In this form of metaprogramming, code is generated programmatically. For
example, you might have a template for generating database access code based on a data model.
Instead of writing the code manually for each table, you use metaprogramming to generate it
automatically.

- *Reflection*: Reflection is the ability of a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure,
classes, methods, and properties at runtime. In languages like Java or C#, you can use
reflection to examine and modify classes, invoke methods, or access fields dynamically.

- *Dynamic Loading*: This involves loading and unloading code modules dynamically at runtime. For
example, in Python, you can use the importlib module to load Python files dynamically as modules.

- *Code Evaluation*: Languages like Python and Ruby allow you to execute dynamically generated code
using eval() or exec() functions. However, using these functions can be risky if the input is
not properly sanitized, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities.

- *Aspect-Oriented Programming* (AOP): AOP is a metaprogramming technique that allows you to define
cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transactions separately from your
core application logic. AOP frameworks can inject these concerns into your code at runtime.


// - Oject-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM.
// - Serialization and deserialization frameworks such as JSON, YAML, and pickle.
// - Dependency injection frameworks such as Dagger and Spring.
// - Testing frameworks such as pytest and unittest.
// - Mocking frameworks such as unittest.mock and mockito.
// - Code generation tools such as ANTLR and Yacc.
// - Static analysis tools such as pylint and mypy.

=== Abstract Base Classes

The abc module provides the ABCMeta metaclass for creating abstract base classes (ABCs). An ABC is
a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to define a common interface for a set of
related classes. Subclasses can then implement this interface to ensure that they can be used
interchangeably with the base class. ABCs are useful for defining APIs and enforcing class
contracts.

=== Metaclasses

A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. A metaclass is used to customize the creation
of classes. A metaclass is defined by inheriting from the type metaclass. The type metaclass is a
class that is used to create all classes in Python. A metaclass can be used to customize the class
creation process by overriding the __new__() method. The __new__() method is called when a class
is created. The __new__() method is responsible for creating and returning the class object. The
__new__() method takes the following arguments:

- cls: The class object
- name: The name of the class
- bases: A tuple of base classes
- attrs: A dictionary of class attributes

=== Aspects

Aspects are cross-cutting concerns that are not related to the core functionality of an application.
Examples of aspects include logging, security, and transactions. AOP is a programming paradigm that
allows you to define aspects separately from the core application logic and inject them into your
code at runtime. AOP frameworks use metaprogramming to inject aspects into your code. AOP is
supported by many languages, including Java, C#, and Python.
