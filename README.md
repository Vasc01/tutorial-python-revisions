Awesome Python!

## Common Guidelines

- Use CamelCase syntaxis

## Commit Rules

* (`#<id>`) - Use as a reference to a concrete issue number (either GitHub or JIRA)
* [`#####`] - No issue or ticket defined for this commit  
* Use a concrete reference of the issue whenever possible (see common guidelines)

Examples:
* (`#19`) - Add the operator precedence examples
* [`#####`] - Move the image assets to a dedicated folder

## Issue Rules

* [`<part>, <chapter>`] - <message>
* The square brackets define the context (optional)
* The context is connected to a place in the document
* If no context is desired then the prefix with the square brackets is omitted altogether

Examples:
* [Part A, Ch. 1] - Do this (with context)
* Do that (without context)
